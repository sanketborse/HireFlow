#HireFlow is an end-to-end GenAI application designed to automate the cold emailing process for job seekers and freelancers. It uses WebBaseLoader to scrape job postings from any URL and cleans the data using utility scripts. The core logic utilizes Groq's Llama-3.1 model to extract key job requirements (skills, role, experience) and matches them against a user's portfolio stored in ChromaDB using vector search. The final output is a context-aware, professionally written email tailored to the specific job opening
